Do you ever wonder what ingredients are in your favorite cosmetics? Did you know that there are over 12,000 chemicals used in cosmetics and personal care products?
A chemical is any substance that has a defined composition. In other words, a chemical is always made up of the same “stuff.” Some chemicals occur in nature, such as water. Other chemicals are manufactured, such as chlorine (used for bleaching fabrics or in swimming pools). Chemicals are all around you: the food you eat, the clothes you wear. You, in fact, are made up of a wide variety of chemicals. But in this context and for the purpose of this analysis, we will be focusing on the chemicals in your cosmetics and personal care products.

**Cosmetics** are constituted mixtures of chemical compounds derived from either natural resources, or synthetically created ones. Cosmetics have various purposes. Those designed for personal care and skin care can be used to cleanse or protect the body or skin. Cosmetics designed to enhance or alter one’s appearance (makeup) can be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one’s natural features (such as the eyebrows and eyelashes), add color to a person’s face, or change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature or object. Cosmetics can also be designed to add fragrance to the body.
